## Checklist
1. Page titles: Check they are different on every page, and follow the page name / club name pattern. 
2. Alt text on images: Useful for visitors using assistive technology. They count on that description to experience the image. 
3. Image size: Check file size and dimensions of images. Optimise before you upload the image to your website.
4. Navigation: Keep it simple. Consider using a secondary menu in the footer of your pages.
5. Contact forms: Fill out your own form to make sure it works. 
6. Social feeds: Remove and replace with something better. For example:
- a call to action to join your club, 
- a list of recent news, 
- or an introduction to your teams. 
7. Visitor counters: If you do want a meaningful idea of who visits your website add Google Analytics instead.
